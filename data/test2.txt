For each processor core that is physically present, the operating system addresses two virtual (logical)
cores and shares the workload between them when possible. The main function of hyper-threading is to increase
the number of independent instructions in the pipeline; it takes advantage of superscalar architecture, in
which multiple instructions operate on separate data in parallel. With HTT, one physical core appears as two
processors to the operating system, allowing concurrent scheduling of two processes per core. In addition,
two or more processes can use the same resources: If resources for one process are not available, then
another process can continue if its resources are available. stop
